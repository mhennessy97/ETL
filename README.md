# ETL

-This repo contains an anlysis of crowdfunding data using ETL. 

-A jupyter notebook is included named "ETL" with backup of the initial analysis and cleaning process of the crowdfunding data. This was used to prepare and export the 4 CSV exports included in the "files/resources" folder. 

-Once each CSV was prepared, an ERD was drafted using quickDB. A snapshot of this has been included in the files folder named "quickdbERD". 

-The ERD was used for reference to set up each table within PostgreSQL and import the data within each CSV. The SQL file has been included as "crowdfunding_db" for backup, and a txt file named "SQLqueries" has been included as well if needed.
